# DNA-Inception
One of the hallmarks of cancer is somatic aberrations in the genomes and transcriptomes of malignant tumors, and this information offers a wealth of distinguishable tumor-specific events, that do not occur in normal tissue of the same individual. Here, we propose DNA-Inception, a convolutional neural network-based model, it follows a sequence-based approach to classify AS events specific to tumor tissues. DNA-Inception takes as an input DNA or RNA sequences of AS events and their corresponding labels based on whether each event occurs in tumor or normal tissue.
